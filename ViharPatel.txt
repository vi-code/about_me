<!-- lag -->Hi there! I am a Computer Science grad from Purdue University who works as a Software Engineer for the genomics and biotechnology company, 23andMe.

I love to work at an organization which fosters creativity and innovation. My academic and professional experience of software development in C++, Python and Java as well as my exposure to Agile methodology and DevOps engineering prepares me for the future!

Most of my weekends are spent hiking, swimming or working out. I box too and would love to train and spar with anyone interested! My interests reside in Cars, American politics and Computing ethics and I'd love to have long and deep discussions about them with anyone.
